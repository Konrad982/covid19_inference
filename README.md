# Disclaimer
This repository is a fork of [the Priesemann Group's Covid-19 inference repository](https://github.com/Priesemann-Group/covid19_inference). It aims to apply the model to different datasets (e.g. from the Johns Hopkins University and national authorities) from different countries. There is no liability for correctness of the data, the statistical inference and the results. Chosen changing points for countries other than Germany reflect my personal judging.

This is a Bayesian python toolbox for inference and forecast of the spread of the Coronavirus.

Check out our [documentation](https://covid19-inference.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/gettingstarted.html).

An example notebook for one bundesland is [here](scripts/example_one_bundesland.ipynb), and for an hierarchical analysis of the bundeslaender [here](scripts/example_bundeslaender.ipynb) (could still have some problems).

The research article [is available on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01105) (**updated on April 13**).
The code used to produce the figures is available in the other repository [here](https://github.com/Priesemann-Group/covid19_inference_forecast)


**We are looking for support** to help us with analyzing other countries and to extend to an hierarchical regional model. We have received additional funding to do so and are recruiting PostDocs, PhD candidates and research assistants:
